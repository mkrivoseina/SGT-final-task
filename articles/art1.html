                <p>Most actors today agree that our modern society has to develop in more sustainable ways. This
                    includes how we produce and consume clothing, shoes, accessories and other textiles. Virtually all
                    major clothing companies in Sweden today have a work in progress in the area of sustainability,
                    particularly in the production phase, but also increasingly at the user level to encourage increased
                    reuse and recycling. At major clothing companies, CSR managers and sustainabilty heads today openly
                    discuss how they work to realign their business models, production processes and store concepts
                    towards improved sustainability.</p>
                <p>But despite the growing interest in sustainability issues within the fashion industry, currently
                    there is no common definition of what sustainable fashion actually means. As a starting point, Green
                    Strategy has developed the following definition of “more sustainable fashion”:</p>
                <p>More sustainable fashion can be defined as clothing, shoes and accessories that are manufactured,
                    marketed and used in the most sustainable manner possible, taking into account both environmental
                    and socio-economic aspects. In practice, this implies continuous work to improve all stages of the
                    product’s life cycle, from design, raw material production, manufacturing, transport, storage,
                    marketing and final sale, to use, reuse, repair, remake and recycling of the product and its
                    components. From an environmental perspective, the aim should be to minimize any undesirable
                    environmental effect of the product’s life cycle by: (a) ensuring efficient and careful use of
                    natural resources (water, energy, land, soil, animals, plants, biodiversity, ecosystems, etc); (b)
                    selecting renewable energy sources (wind, solar, etc) at every stage, and (c) maximizing repair,
                    remake, reuse, and recycling of the product and its components. From a socio-economic perspective,
                    all stakeholders should work to improve present working conditions for workers on the field, in the
                    factories, transportation chain, and stores, by aligning with good ethics, best practice and
                    international codes of conduct. In addition, fashion companies should contribute to encourage more
                    sustainable consumption patterns, caring and washing practices, and overall attitudes to fashion.
                    (Dr. Brismar, Green Strategy)</p>
                <p>Sustainable fashion is thus partly about producing clothes, shoes and accessories in environmentally
                    and socio-economically sustainable manners, but also about more sustainable patterns of consumption
                    and use, which necessitate shifts in individual attitudes and behaviour. However, there are many
                    ways for fashion companies to offer a more sustainable fashion, and for consumers to consume more
                    sustainably. Green Strategy has identified seven forms of more sustainable fashion from both a
                    producer and consumer perspective.</p>
                <p>The main responsibility of fashion companies is obviously to change their production, distribution
                    and marketing practices and strategies towards greater sustainability. But companies also have the
                    possiblity to contribute to more sustainable consumption patterns. Some Swedish fashion companies
                    provide fashion as second hand or have initiated rental systems for leasing clothes and accessories.
                    Other companies focus mainly on creating fashion that is of high quality and timeless design, i.e.
                    of long-lasting style and durability. Other companies (e.g. H&M) have set up collection and
                    recycling systems that supports increased textile recycling. Some companies choose to partner with
                    I:CO, for example H&M, Adidas, Jack&Jones, Puma and the North Face. To manufacture clothes with
                    certified textiles (according to environmental labels and Fair trade) is another strategy to promote
                    more concious consumption patterns.</p>
                <p>Green Strategy supports all the above strategies and activities that increase a company’s
                    sustainability performance and encourage more sustainable production and consumption patterns.</p>
